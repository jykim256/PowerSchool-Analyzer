# PowerSchool-Analyzer
Use Beautiful Soup and Excel to analyze tables from PowerSchool

Wrote most of the code over 3 days in Christmas break of 2015, but the most recent version should still work.

Mostly a project to learn about different aspects of Github (pull requests, branches, pushes, etc.) by going through the motions as if I am working on this project. I just had previous versions that I saved with different version numbers for version control that I can use to show some of the major progress.

v1.0 - Used Selenium that initalized a computer controlled browser that would just automate the clicks to print the Data

v1.1 - Instead of printing data onto command line, wrote to Excel file with charts and graphs to gain a better understanding of student's performance

v2.0 - Used Beautful Soup 4 to parse and scrape data instead of Selenium, cutting time by more than 3x with no random window showing up.

Usage Instructions coming soon after I upload the final verison.

I understand that the code is cringe-inducing. The Exception handling was rushed to just complete the project and lack of comments was because I understood everything.

There will be a post-final version with much of the code revamped and the architecture rewritten for the sake of clarity.

GUI coming possibly.
